**Project Report: Fake News Classification Using Neural Networks**

### 1. Introduction and Project Objectives
**Introduction**:  
The proliferation of misinformation poses a significant threat to the public’s access to reliable information, particularly through online news platforms. Identifying and flagging fake news in real time can aid in curbing the spread of false information. This project explores the application of supervised machine learning techniques for fake news detection using Dense Neural Networks (Dense NN), vanilla Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models.

**Objectives**:  
The main objective is to develop and evaluate three supervised learning models—Dense NN, vanilla RNN, and LSTM—on a dataset of labeled news articles. This evaluation will determine each model's effectiveness in identifying unreliable news articles, based on standard performance metrics. Our goal is to identify the most accurate architecture for fake news detection, thus contributing to potential solutions for automated misinformation filtering.
